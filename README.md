📅 Assignments
JavaScript JavaScript Assignments
No.	Topic	Description
1	Introduction to Variables and Types	Create variables using let, const, and var and print their values. Practice different data types: strings, numbers, booleans, and arrays.
2	Functions and Scope	Write a simple function to return the square of a number. Explore function parameters, return values, and scope (global vs local).
3	Conditional Statements (If-Else)	Build a simple age-checking application using if-else statements to categorize users as a child, teenager, or adult based on their age.
4	Loops (For and While)	Use a for loop to print numbers 1 to 10. Then, use a while loop to print 10 of your hobbies.
5	Arrays and Loops	Write a program that iterates through an array of your favorite movies and logs each one to the console.
6	Objects and Methods	Create an object representing a "car" with properties like make, model, and year. Write a method to return a description of the car.
7	Event Handling	Create a button that, when clicked, changes the background color of the page. Learn about addEventListener and how events work in JavaScript.
8	DOM Manipulation	Create a dynamic counter that increases and decreases a number every time the user clicks on a button. Display the current value of the counter.
🚀 Project Assignment: Rock Paper Scissors Game

Now, it's time to bring everything together with your JavaScript Project! Build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user can select one of the three options, and the computer randomly selects one as well. The game should:

Display the user's choice and the computer's choice.
Display the result (win, lose, or draw).
Keep track of the score (number of wins, losses, and ties).
Include a button to reset the game.
Skills Practice
Throughout this study jam, focus on building your problem-solving skills and your ability to break down tasks into manageable steps. As you go through the assignments, take time to experiment and explore the code on your own. This is your opportunity to strengthen your understanding of JavaScript and become more comfortable with coding in a real-world context.
